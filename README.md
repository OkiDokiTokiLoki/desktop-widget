<h3>Desktop widget</h3>

[Live demo](https://okidokitokiloki.github.io/desktop-widget/) (doesn't display weather)

## General info
A small program that displays time, weather, and other info.

* This program allows users to input a town/city in a search box which will return current weather-related information. 

* Users also have the option to relax to some sounds of nature with a timer, fade-out and volume control.

## Getting started
The live demo doesn't showcase the weather display.   

-- In order to view it, you will first have to subscribe (free) to the "Current weather data" API on [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).

-- Fork this project and create a config.js file inside of the "javascript" folder. 

-- In the config.js file, create a new `const api` object with `key: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` and `base: 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5'` properties.

-- The config.js file is already linked in the html.
