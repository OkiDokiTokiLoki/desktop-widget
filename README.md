<h3>desktop widget</h3>

## General info
<strong>This is a wip.</strong> A small program that displays time, weather, and other info.

This program allows users to input a town/city in a search box which will return current weather-related information. 

There is also a very simple calculator - error handling still needs to be implemented.

Finally, users also have the option to relax to some sounds of nature with a timer, fade-out and volume control.
